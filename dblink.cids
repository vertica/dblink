# Vertica DBLINK Configuration File
#
# Connection IDs lines have the following format:
#    <mnemonic code>:<ODBC configuration>
# and are terminated by a SINGLE '\n' (ASCII dec 10, ASCII hex 0x0a)
# Be aware of this! Windows editors might end lines with \r\n. In
# this case the Carriage Return is considered part of the ODBC config
# and can cause undefined ODBC Driver Behavior.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are considered comments
#
# Sample configuration:

mypg:UID=mauro;PWD=xxx;DSN=pmf
malformed string
myver:UID=mauro;PWD=xxx;DSN=vmf
mysql:USER=mauro;PASSWORD=xxx;DSN=mmf
